# Python-based console game
## Brief introduction
This project is probably one of my fastest projects, which is basically a simple console-text game where you pick a player, and multiple cars are trying to reach the finish line. The determining factor of a car progressing is a random chance.

The purpose of this project was to improve upon a project my teacher was trying to work on, so I spent 30 minutes creating it, and adding a few new features which made it look a lot more polished.

Unfortunately this only works on Windows, as I used a specific OS command that is only compatible with Windows.
